A flowering plant that grows in patches in the valleys of a particular mountain range, resembling common wildflowers to all but an expert inspection. 

For one day, after growing for ten years, the fields of these plants bloom. During the night the petals are shed. The whole flower can be consumed as a component in a ritual to view that space at any other time, dependent upon the parameters of the ritual.
