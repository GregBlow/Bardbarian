In labyrinths of coral caves.

An echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

A submarine cave, formed by coral, off an island known for nesting tropical albatrosses. 

Contains the Theramin of the Winds submerged in a rock (coral) pool

It is held in place by a mechanism, controlled by 4 pedastals that burn with a turquise flame, that also maintain the water level of the pool and provide the only light for the cavern
